# 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Fullerton

I'm a passionate developer and AI enthusiast exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large language models.

My goal with **AI Talks** is to share insights, experiments, and learnings from my journey building and studying AI systems. Whether it's deep learning models, data-driven workflows, or thought pieces on the future of tech, you'll find it here. I treat thie blog as a journal and a way to weight my thoughts about AT, and maybe add a little bias in there.
